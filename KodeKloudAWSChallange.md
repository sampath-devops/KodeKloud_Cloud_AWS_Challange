# Day 1: Create Key Pair
  # Requirement:
        The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process.

        For this task, create a key pair with the following requirements:

        Name of the key pair should be datacenter-kp.

        Key pair type must be rsa

        Use below given AWS Credentials: (You can run the showcreds command on aws-client host to retrieve these credentials)

        Console URL	https://093501631776.signin.aws.amazon.com/console?region=us-east-1
        Username	kk_labs_user_411033
        Password	24Q5z9GLT%dl
        Start Time	Sat Mar 14 18:26:30 UTC 2026
        End Time	Sat Mar 14 19:26:30 UTC 2026

        Notes:

        Create the resources only in us-east-1 region.

        To display or hide the terminal of the AWS client machine, you can use the expand toggle button as shown below:
